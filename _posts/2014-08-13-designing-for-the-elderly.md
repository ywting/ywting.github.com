I was thinking about the implementation of the iconic foundry when I was travelling on the train to school some time last month when my attention was suddenly distracted by a series of sound. The sound drew my attention as it was moderately loud. I was standing near the middle of the cabin while the sound was coming from the seat on my right. It appeared that there was a senior playing temple run on his Android phone.  

The senior did nothing but held his phone in the portrait position for the next five minutes while the game ran on the machine. The only action which he did was tapping on the replay button everytime his character dies. Approximately five minutes into the game, the senior tried a series of actions which included tapping on the screen in attempt to control the in-game character. This is when I realised that he has no idea how to actually play the game.

He finally managed to understand the mechanics of the game after tapping and swiping the screenn for a couple of minutes. He gave up on the game shortly after that, and launched another one. It was a car racing game this instance. As before, the phone was still held in a portrait position, although the screen was automatically rotated and locked at landscape position. The senior played the car racing game for the next couple of minutes before he realised that he should actually tilt his phone 90 degree for a better gaming experience.

#### An issue not too far away

It did not occur to me that many designers or rather designs have neglected elderlies into the planning stage of the design processes until when I witness a case of such negligence happening right in front of me at my very own house. My mother, who is in her fifties, was trying to search for a video on a video streaming application on our Android tablet. Like many current mobile applications, there was a search bar on the top right hand corner of the screen. There was, unfortunately, no label or placeholder text in the search bar itself. The only thing which was present in the close proximity of the search bar was an icon of a magnifying glass. Although the magnifying glass icon is synonymous to the search function, we as designers cannot assume that every user understands the connection.

#### Should the elderlies embrace technology?

My girlfriend, who is also a user experience/interaction researcher, believes that the elderlies have a harder time adapting to technology because they are more conscious of the devices when using them. She had a discussion with her colleague who thinks that technology is more of a privilege, but not a necessity for the elderlies. My girlfriend and I disagree on this notion. Personally, I believe that we should take the opinions of the elderlies into consideration, although they do not belong to all product user groups. This is essentially to decrease the digital divide between themselves and the younger generation. 

Similar to mobile adaptation, we as designer can integrate considerations for elderly during the early planning stage of our design process. Some of the design principles which we can adopt when designing for elderly can also improve the user experience for the rest of the user groups. For example, every icon on the interface should be accompanied with a label, and the font size on smaller mobile devices should be increased to improve readability. As of the first case which I have described earlier, applications and software should have an onboarding guide for new users. Designers and developers could also make use of the existing orientation sensor to sense the deviceâ€™s position, and prompt users to rotate their device when need be.  In general, complex steps should also be broken down into smaller steps to reduce the learning curve for senior users.

In additional to improving our designs for the elderlies by applying various design patterns, we should also encourage the seniors to pick up and learn how to integrate technology into their daily lives instead of creating a mental barrier between them and the technology.

#### Summary

We as designers are responsible for the products which we designed. Although it is impossible to design for everyone, we should not, however cast aside the seniors and not deny them a piece of technology.  The least that a designer can do is stop assuming and apply various design patterns to into their designs. This is to reduce ambigity in our designs. We should also encourage seniors to try out new technology instead of shunning them. Increasing interactions with technology will bridge the gap between the seniors and the younger generations and reduce the digital divide.
